### (2) Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) (2 min)

https://run.pavlovia.org/sijiazhao/ect_dsst

OUTCOME: Number of correct matches. Hit rate.

### (3) Wordlist Free Recall Memory task (5 min)

### (4) Oxford Memory Test (OMT) (10 min)

https://run.pavlovia.org/sijiazhao/ect_omt

OUTCOME: This task yields a lot of useful measures. The key ones are proportion correct, location error, the rate that the stimulus is correctly identified and placed on the target location, the error rate that the participant misbinds one stimulus with the distractors. RT for identification, RT for localisation. These metrics for are available for both easy (1 fractal) condition and (3 fractal) condition.

### (8) Object-in-Scene Memory Task (OIS) (12 min)

https://run.pavlovia.org/sijiazhao/ect_ois

### (9) Wordlist Free Recall Memory task - delayed recall (2 min)

Details: green button appears at the centre of the screen, and the subject needs to press the button as soon as possible. 60 trials, ITI randomised between 1 and 2s
OUTCOME: Mean/median/SD of RTs.

### (5) Choice Reaction Time (CRT) (2 minutes)  

https://run.pavlovia.org/sijiazhao/ect_crt
