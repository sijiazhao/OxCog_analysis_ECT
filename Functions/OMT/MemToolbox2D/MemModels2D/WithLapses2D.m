% WITHLAPSES2D adds a lapse ("inattentional") term to any model
%
%  model = WithLapses2D(model, [priorForLapseRate])
%
% The first parameter is the model to convert; the second (optional)
% parameter is a function for the prior on the lapse rate. It takes a single
% argument, lapseRate.
%
% The lapse parameter adds in the possibility that observers might
% randomly guess on some proportion of trials ('lapses'). This is
% functionally identical to the guess parameters that already exist in
% several models (e.g.,StandardMixtureModel2D).
%
% Thus, to take the NoGuessingModel2D, which has a standard deviation (sd),
% and add an additional lapse term (lapseRate), just use:
%
%   model = WithLapses2D(NoGuessingModel2D())
%
% This model would then be identical to the StandardMixtureModel2D (since
% it will consist of both an sd and guess parameter).
%
% This wrapper is compatible with both TwoAFC2D(). For
% example, the following works fine:
%
%   model = TwoAFC2D(WithLapses2D(NoGuessingModel2D()));
%

  % Warn if the model already has a guess rate or lapse rate. Note that the built-in
