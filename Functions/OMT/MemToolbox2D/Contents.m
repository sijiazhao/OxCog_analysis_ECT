% MemToolbox2D 1.0.0
%
% MemToolbox2D is a Matlab package for modelling 2D spatial working memory
% tasks. It is built to work with MemToolbox (Suchow et al., 2013;
% MemToolbox.org) and requires that package be in the Matlab path too.
% This package contains 2D version of all the models in MemToolbox, plus
% versions of some of the functions that had to be adapted for 2D - all
% other functions work the same in 1D and 2D.
% 
% MemToolbox2D is released under a BSD license, as was the original
% package.
% 
% To install, first install MemToolbox (MemToolbox.org) and then add the
% MemToolbox2D folder and all the subfolders to your path (or use the
% setup.m script in MemToolbox2D).
%
% If you want to acknowledge use of this software when you publish your
% research, you might say something like, "Data analysis was performed
% in MATLAB using the MemToolbox2D (Grogan et al., in press; Suchow, Brady,
% Fougnie & Alvarez, in press)."
%
% and then cite
%
